## Requeriments:
-Use a Styled Components solution of your choice ✅
-Show placeholder/skeleton for stories and comments while loading
-Respect list item identation for comments
-Each page should have a unique URL(EX. Localhost:8080/article/12121). It should be a SPA but all URLs should be accesible by direct link. ✅


## Instructions: 
Part 1: Write a React or React Native app that fetches and displays the top 10 stories from Hacker News using the Hacker News API - https://github.com/HackerNews/API

Part2: If you click into a story, you should see the comments in a diferente page. Fetch and display the first 10 comments and their children using the Hacker News API.
You may use any additional librarries you deem necessary. ( remember respecting nested comments)

Part 3: Implement an infinite scroll for top stories by using a "Load more" button.

Part 4: Ensure scroll to the bottom every time new stories are loaded.

Part 5: Make API call to fetch comments to fail 75% of the times, and handle the error gracefully.

## Evaluation Criteria:
